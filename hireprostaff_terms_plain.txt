 5.2 Control and Independence Factors

Staff Users maintain complete independence, autonomy, and control over their work, specifically demonstrated by the following factors:

5.2.1 Rate Levels Determined by HireProStaff Based on Experience

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:

(a) Experience-Based Rate Setting:
- HireProStaff assigns Rate Levels to Staff Users based on their verified Experience Level;
- Experience Level is determined through objective assessment of:
  - Years of relevant hospitality experience;
  - Formal qualifications and certifications;
  - Specialized skills and expertise;
  - References and work history verification;
  - Performance ratings from previous Shifts;
  - Skills assessments conducted by HireProStaff.

(b) Purpose of Rate Setting:
HireProStaff's rate-setting function serves the following legitimate purposes:
- Ensuring compliance with National Minimum Wage Act and Sectoral Determination 14;
- Maintaining quality standards across the Platform;
- Providing market-consistent pricing to Business Users;
- Preventing exploitation and ensuring fair compensation;
- Enabling efficient marketplace operation;
- Reducing negotiation friction and transaction costs;
- Protecting both Users from market abuse.

(c) Rate Transparency:
- Staff Users' assigned Rate Level is clearly communicated during registration and onboarding;
- Rate Levels are subject to periodic review and may be increased based on:
  - Improved qualifications or certifications;
  - Consistent high performance ratings;
  - Additional experience gained;
  - Inflation and market rate adjustments;
- Staff Users will be notified of Rate Level changes;
- Historical rate information is available in User accounts.

(d) Rate Flexibility for Lower-Level Shifts:

  - Gain experience in new areas;
  - Maximize income during slow periods;
  - Build relationships with new Business Users;
- Staff Users may NOT accept Shifts ABOVE their assigned Rate Level unless they have been promoted to a higher Experience Level;
- This restriction ensures service quality and Business User expectations are met.

(e) No Employment Relationship Created:
- HireProStaff's rate-setting function does NOT create an employment relationship;
- Rate setting is a marketplace regulation function, not an employer control function;
- Many digital platforms set rates or fees without creating employment relationships;
- Rate setting ensures platform integrity and legal compliance;
- Courts have recognized that rate regulation alone does not create employment (see Uber BV v Aslam [UK], Razak v Uber South Africa Technology Services [SA]);
- Staff Users remain independent contractors with autonomy over:
  - Which Shifts to accept or decline;
  - When to work and for how long;
  - Whether to work at all on any given day;
  - Work methods and techniques employed;
  - Multiple client relationships.

5.2.2 Absolute Work Acceptance Discretion

Staff Users have unfettered, absolute discretion to accept or decline any Shift opportunity without penalty, restriction, or consequence, specifically:

(a) No Compulsion:
- Staff Users are NEVER required to accept any Shift;
- No minimum acceptance rate is required or expected;
- No quotas or targets for Shift acceptance exist;
- Staff Users may decline Shifts for ANY reason or NO reason;
- No explanations or justifications for declinations are required.

(b) No Penalties:
- Declining Shifts carries ZERO penalties, including:
  - No account deactivation or suspension;
  - No reduction in Rate Level;
  - No demotion or negative status changes;
  - No negative ratings or reviews from HireProStaff;
  - No reduced visibility in search results (except as affected by availability settings);
  - No financial penalties or forfeiture;
  - No negative records maintained.

(c) Availability Self-Management:
- Staff Users set their own availability through the Platform;
- Availability can be changed at any time without notice;
- Staff Users may set themselves as "unavailable" indefinitely;
- No minimum availability is required;
- "Unavailable" status does not affect account standing.

(d) No Adverse Consequences:
- Low acceptance rates do NOT result in:
  - Account deactivation;
  - Warnings or disciplinary action;
  - Communication from HireProStaff pressuring acceptance;
  - Any other negative outcome.

(e) Right to Be Selective:
- Staff Users may accept only Shifts that:
  - Are convenient to their schedules;
  - Offer preferred types of work;
  - Are at desirable locations;
  - Meet their personal or financial preferences;
  - Align with their availability and other commitments.

5.2.3 Multi-Platform and Multi-Client Freedom

Staff Users enjoy complete freedom to work for multiple parties and platforms simultaneously, specifically:

(a) Competing Platforms:
- Staff Users may register on and work for competing hospitality staffing platforms simultaneously;
- No exclusivity is required or expected;
- Staff Users may allocate their time and services as they choose among platforms;
- HireProStaff imposes NO restrictions on multi-platform work;
- Staff Users may openly discuss or promote other platforms.

(b) Direct Client Relationships:
- Staff Users may maintain direct, private client relationships OUTSIDE the Platform;
- Staff Users may seek and accept work directly from businesses without using the Platform;
- Staff Users may develop ongoing independent contractor relationships with businesses met through the Platform AFTER the initial engagement;
- No prohibition on direct dealings exists (subject to Section 29 confidentiality obligations);
- Staff Users may advertise their services independently through any channels.

(c) Other Employment or Business:
- Staff Users may maintain full-time or part-time employment elsewhere;
- Staff Users may operate other businesses or freelance ventures;

- No restrictions on outside work exist;
- Platform work may constitute the User's primary, secondary, tertiary, or minimal income source at their discretion.

(d) Client Diversification Encouraged:
- Staff Users are ENCOURAGED to diversify their client base;
- Reliance on any single platform or client is inadvisable;
- Economic independence is a hallmark of independent contractor status;
- HireProStaff supports Staff Users in building sustainable, diversified businesses.

5.2.4 Operational Independence

Staff Users maintain complete operational independence over how they conduct their business, specifically:

(a) Tools and Equipment:
- Staff Users generally provide their own professional tools and equipment, including:
  - Professional attire and uniforms;
  - Personal tools of the trade (e.g., sommelier tools, chef knives);
  - Transportation to and from Shifts;
  - Mobile devices for communication;
  - Any other personal equipment.
- Where Business Users provide equipment due to venue-specific requirements (e.g., branded uniforms, specialized tools), such provision is:
  - Incidental and temporary;
  - Required by the nature of the venue, not the work;
  - Comparable to a contractor using a client's premises;
  - Not indicative of an employment relationship.

(b) Work Methods:
- Staff Users apply their own professional judgment, experience, and expertise;
- Staff Users determine HOW to perform tasks within industry standards;
- Business Users may specify OUTCOMES but not METHODS;

- Complete flexibility in work patterns is maintained.

(d) Professional Development:

(e) Business Administration:
- Staff Users maintain their own business records;
- Staff Users handle their own tax affairs;
- Staff Users manage their own insurance and risk;
- Staff Users make their own business decisions;
- Complete business autonomy is maintained.

 5.3 Nature of Engagement

5.3.1 Discrete Transaction Basis

Each Shift represents a separate, discrete, independent transaction between a Staff User and Business User, specifically:

(a) No Continuing Relationship:
- Each Shift is a separate contract for services;
- Completion of one Shift creates NO obligation or expectation of future Shifts;
- No ongoing service relationship exists between Shifts;
- Gaps between Shifts are expected, normal, and do not affect relationship;
- Each Shift must be separately booked and accepted.

(b) No Cumulative Relationship:
- Multiple Shifts do NOT accumulate into an ongoing employment relationship;
- The legal character of each Shift remains identical regardless of volume;
- Repeated bookings do NOT transform the relationship into employment;
- Each Shift is analyzed independently for classification purposes.

(c) Right to Refuse Future Shifts:
- Acceptance of past Shifts creates NO obligation to accept future Shifts;
- Staff Users may work once and never again without consequence;
- Business Users may book a Staff User once and never again without consequence;
- Either party may terminate the relationship at any time by simply not booking/accepting future Shifts.

(d) Economic Independence Maintained:
- Staff Users are not economically dependent on any single Business User;
- Staff Users are not economically dependent on HireProStaff;
- Income from any single source should not constitute Staff User's primary livelihood;
- Economic risk is borne by the Staff User, not spread across an employer.

5.3.2 No Integration into HireProStaff Operations

Staff Users are NOT integrated into HireProStaff's business operations or organizational structure, demonstrated by:

- Staff Users do NOT hold themselves out as HireProStaff employees or agents;
- Staff Users do NOT use HireProStaff business cards, email addresses, or other corporate identity;
- Staff Users provide services in their own names to Business Users.

(d) No HireProStaff Branding:
- Staff Users do NOT wear HireProStaff uniforms (except optional branded apparel for marketing);
- Staff Users wear venue-appropriate attire or Business User uniforms;
- Staff Users are NOT identified as "HireProStaff staff" during Shifts;
- Visual association with HireProStaff is minimal and incidental.

(e) No Corporate Culture Participation:
- Staff Users are NOT part of HireProStaff's corporate culture;
- Staff Users do NOT attend social events or team-building activities;
- Staff Users do NOT receive corporate communications (except Platform-related notices);
- No sense of belonging to a "HireProStaff team" is created or encouraged.

5.3.3 Business User Integration (Not HireProStaff)

Importantly, during Shifts, Staff Users MAY be temporarily integrated into the Business User's operations, which integration:
- Is directed by and for the benefit of the Business User, NOT HireProStaff;
- Reflects the Staff User's service contract with the Business User;
- Does NOT create an employment relationship with the Business User (due to discrete engagement nature);
- Is consistent with independent contractor status where contractors work on client premises.

 5.4 Economic Independence

5.4.1 Staff User Acknowledgment

Staff Users explicitly acknowledge, understand, and agree that they:

(a) Are Not Economically Dependent:
- Are NOT economically dependent on HireProStaff for their livelihood;
- Do NOT derive the majority of their income from HireProStaff Shifts;

- Hospitality work is inherently seasonal and variable;
- Financial planning must account for income variability;
- Staff Users bear sole responsibility for managing variable income;
- No complaints about income variability will be entertained.


 6. SECTION 200A LABOUR RELATIONS ACT COMPLIANCE

 6.1 Recognition of Statutory Presumption

6.1.1 Acknowledgment of Section 200A  
The parties acknowledge and recognize that Section 200A of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, as amended, creates a rebuttable presumption that a person is an employee if one or more of the following factors are present:

(a) The manner in which the person works is subject to the control or direction of another person;

(b) The person's hours of work are subject to the control or direction of another person;

(c) In the case of a person who works for an organisation, the person forms part of that organisation;

(d) The person has worked for that other person for an average of at least 40 hours per month over the last three months;

(e) The person is economically dependent on the other person for whom they work or render services;

(f) The person is provided with tools of trade or work equipment by the other person;

(g) The person only works for or renders services to one person.

6.1.2 Purpose of This Section  
This Section 6 specifically addresses how the relationship between HireProStaff, Staff Users, and Business Users has been structured to ensure that:
- The Section 200A presumption does NOT arise in the relationship between HireProStaff and Staff Users;
- If the presumption were alleged to arise, it can be SUCCESSFULLY REBUTTED with clear evidence;
- The independent contractor classification withstands legal scrutiny;
- All parties' intentions and actual conduct align with independent contractor status.

 6.2 Rebuttal of Employment Factors

The following comprehensive analysis demonstrates why each Section 200A factor either does NOT apply or is clearly rebutted:

6.2.1 Factor (a): Manner of Work Performance - NO CONTROL

✓ SECTION 200A(a) REBUTTED:

(i) No HireProStaff Control:
- HireProStaff does NOT control or direct the manner in which Staff Users perform their work during Shifts;
- HireProStaff is NOT present at Business User venues during Shifts;
- HireProStaff does NOT supervise, monitor, or oversee work performance;
- HireProStaff does NOT provide instructions on how to perform hospitality tasks;
- HireProStaff does NOT dictate work methods, techniques, or approaches;
- HireProStaff's involvement ends once the Shift is booked and payment processed.

(ii) Business User Direction is Outcome-Based:
- Business Users may specify DESIRED OUTCOMES (e.g., "serve tables," "prepare dishes," "clean rooms");
- Business Users do NOT dictate the specific manner, methods, or techniques used to achieve outcomes;
- Staff Users apply their own professional judgment, skills, and experience;
- Staff Users use industry-standard methods they have developed through training and experience;
- Direction given by Business Users is comparable to a client instructing an independent contractor on deliverables, not an employer controlling an employee.

(iii) Professional Autonomy:
- Staff Users are hired BECAUSE they possess professional competence and expertise;
- Business Users rely on Staff Users' independent professional judgment;
- Staff Users make autonomous decisions about:
  - Specific techniques and methods to use;
  - How to prioritize tasks;
  - How to handle unexpected situations;
  - Professional best practices application;
- This professional autonomy is the essence of independent contractor status.

(iv) Comparison to Employees:
- Unlike employees who are trained, supervised, and directed in work methods:
- Staff Users arrive with pre-existing professional competence;
- Staff Users require minimal supervision;
- Staff Users self-direct their work within outcome parameters;
- Staff Users are assessed on results, not compliance with prescribed methods.

6.2.2 Factor (b): Working Time Control - NO TIME CONTROL

✓ SECTION 200A(b) REBUTTED:

(i) Absolute Shift Acceptance Discretion:
- Staff Users have COMPLETE control over when they work;
- Staff Users decide:
  - Whether to work at all on any given day, week, or month;
  - How many hours per day, week, or month to work;
  - Which specific Shifts to accept from available opportunities;
  - When to make themselves available or unavailable;
- NO minimum hours are required or imposed;
- NO schedules or rosters are created by HireProStaff;
- Staff Users can work intensively for periods and then take extended breaks.

(ii) Within-Shift Time is Client-Directed:
- Once a Shift is accepted, the Shift has defined start and end times (e.g., "2:00 PM to 10:00 PM");
- This is comparable to any service contract with defined deliverables (e.g., a plumber agreeing to work on specific days);
- Business Users determine when services are needed (outcome), not how Staff Users structure their overall working time;
- Staff Users are free to accept or reject Shifts at particular times;
- The fact that a Shift has defined hours does not constitute "control over working hours" in the Section 200A sense.

(iii) No Overall Time Control:
- HireProStaff has ZERO control over Staff Users' overall working time;
- Staff Users determine their total working hours across all clients and platforms;
- Staff Users can work 0 hours, 10 hours, or 60+ hours per week at their sole discretion;
- No expectations, targets, or requirements regarding working time exist.

(iv) Comparison to Employees:
- Employees have prescribed working hours, shifts, or rosters set by employers;
- Employees cannot refuse assigned hours without permission;
- Employees are required to work specified schedules;
- Staff Users have none of these restrictions - they unilaterally control when they work.

6.2.3 Factor (c): Part of Organization - NO INTEGRATION

✓ SECTION 200A(c) REBUTTED:

(i) No Integration into HireProStaff:
As detailed in Section 5.3.2, Staff Users are NOT integrated into HireProStaff's organization:
- Not on organizational charts;
- No reporting lines to HireProStaff management;
- No participation in meetings, training, or corporate culture;
- No HireProStaff email addresses or business cards;
- Not held out as HireProStaff employees or agents;
- Not wearing HireProStaff uniforms or branding during work;
- Not subject to HireProStaff's internal policies or procedures.

(ii) HireProStaff is a Platform, Not a Hospitality Business:
- HireProStaff's core business is TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM provision, not hospitality services;
- Staff Users are hospitality professionals, not technology workers;
- Staff Users do NOT form part of HireProStaff's technology operations;
- Staff Users are customers/users of the platform, not organizational members;
- The relationship is B2B (business-to-business), not employer-employee.

(iii) Temporary Integration into Business User Operations:
- Staff Users may be temporarily integrated into Business User operations during Shifts;
- This integration:
  - Is directed by the Business User, not HireProStaff;
  - Reflects the service contract between Staff User and Business User;
  - Is temporary and limited to the specific Shift duration;
  - Does NOT create employment with the Business User due to discrete, transactional nature;
  - Is comparable to independent contractors working on client premises.

(iv) Multiple Client Model:
- Staff Users work for multiple Business Users;
- Staff Users do not become "part of" each Business User's organization;
- The multi-client model prevents organizational integration;
- Staff Users maintain independent professional identity across all engagements.

6.2.4 Factor (d): 40-Hour Threshold - UNLIKELY AND NON-DETERMINATIVE

✓ SECTION 200A(d) ADDRESSED:

(i) Platform Designed for Flexibility:
- The Platform is specifically designed to facilitate FLEXIBLE, AD-HOC work;
- Most Staff Users work LESS than 40 hours per month through HireProStaff;
- The typical use case is SUPPLEMENTAL income, not full-time work;
- Staff Users are encouraged to diversify across multiple platforms and clients.

(ii) If 40-Hour Threshold Exceeded:
- Some Staff Users may, by choice, work more than an average of 40 hours per month;
- This alone does NOT create employment under Section 200A;
- Factor (d) is just ONE factor; presumption arises only if one OR MORE factors present;
- Even if factor (d) is present, the presumption is REBUTTABLE;
- Clear evidence (all other factors) rebuts any presumption arising from hours worked.

(iii) Hours Worked ≠ Employment:
- Courts have recognized that volume of work alone does not determine status;
- Independent contractors may work substantial hours for single clients;
- The nature of the relationship (control, integration, economic dependence) is determinative;
- Other factors comprehensively demonstrate independent contractor status;
- Factor (d), if present, is far outweighed by the absence of all other factors.

6.2.5 Factor (e): Economic Dependence - NO DEPENDENCE

✓ SECTION 200A(e) REBUTTED:

(i) No Economic Dependence on HireProStaff:
As detailed in Section 5.4, Staff Users are NOT economically dependent on HireProStaff:
- Staff Users have multiple income sources;
- Staff Users work for multiple platforms and clients;
- Platform income is typically supplemental, not primary;
- Staff Users can sustain themselves without HireProStaff income;
- Economic risk is borne by Staff Users, not HireProStaff.

(ii) Multi-Platform and Multi-Client Reality:
- Most Staff Users are registered on multiple platforms;
- Most Staff Users maintain direct client relationships;
- Many Staff Users have other employment or businesses;
- Diversification is encouraged and expected;
- Single-source dependence is contrary to Platform design and usage.

(iii) No HireProStaff Financial Support:
- HireProStaff provides NO financial support, guarantees, or assistance;
- No minimum income is guaranteed;
- Staff Users bear full risk of income variability;
- Economic insecurity rests with Staff User, not HireProStaff;
- This contrasts sharply with employment relationships where employer bears economic risk.

(iv) Statistical Evidence:
[HireProStaff should maintain and be able to produce statistical evidence showing]:
- Average percentage of Staff Users' total income derived from Platform;
- Average number of hours worked per Staff User per month;
- Evidence of multi-platform registration (where verifiable);
- Evidence that most Staff Users work below 40-hour threshold;
- Demonstrable economic independence.

6.2.6 Factor (f): Tools and Equipment - MINIMAL PROVISION

✓ SECTION 200A(f) REBUTTED:

(i) Staff Users Provide Own Tools:
As detailed in Section 5.2.4(a), Staff Users generally provide their own:
- Professional attire and uniforms;
- Personal professional tools (chef knives, sommelier tools, etc.);
- Transportation to and from Shifts;
- Mobile devices and communication tools;
- Any other personal equipment necessary for professional practice.

(ii) Business User Equipment Provision is Venue-Specific:
- Where Business Users provide equipment, it is due to venue-specific requirements:
  - Venue-branded uniforms;
  - Large commercial kitchen equipment (ovens, refrigerators);
  - Specialized venue equipment (POS systems, glassware, crockery);
  - Safety equipment required by venue (fire safety gear, first aid kits);
- Such provision is:
  - Incidental and temporary;
  - Required by the nature of the venue, not the nature of the work;
  - Comparable to an independent contractor using a client's premises and facilities;
  - Not indicative of employment (e.g., a contractor using a client's Wi-Fi, office space, or tools does not become an employee).

(iii) HireProStaff Provides NO Work Equipment:
- HireProStaff provides ZERO physical tools or equipment for Shift performance;
- HireProStaff provides ONLY digital platform access (software, not physical tools);
- Platform access is analogous to Uber's app or Airbnb's website - it's marketplace infrastructure, not work tools;
- No investment in Staff User's physical tools or work equipment is made.

(iv) Comparison to Traditional Employment:
- Employees typically receive ALL necessary tools and equipment from employers;
- Employees do not invest in work equipment;
- Staff Users must invest in their own professional tools and attire;
- This capital investment is a hallmark of independent contractor status.

6.2.7 Factor (g): Single Client - EXPLICITLY PREVENTED

✓ SECTION 200A(g) REBUTTED:

(i) Multi-Client Model Designed:
- Platform is SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED for Staff Users to work for multiple Business Users;
- Staff Users work for numerous different Business Users;
- Each Business User books Staff Users for discrete Shifts;
- No exclusivity arrangements exist;
- No restrictions on working for other parties exist.

(ii) Active Multi-Client Encouragement:
- Staff Users are ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED to:
  - Work for multiple Business Users through the Platform;
  - Maintain direct client relationships outside the Platform;
  - Register on competing platforms;
  - Diversify their client base for economic stability;
- HireProStaff's business model depends on Staff Users serving multiple Business Users.

(iii) Statistical Reality:
[HireProStaff should maintain and produce evidence]:
- Average number of different Business Users each Staff User works for per month;
- Evidence that the vast majority of Staff Users work for multiple Business Users;
- Demonstrable multi-client engagement patterns.

(iv) Single-Client Scenario:
- If a Staff User chooses to work exclusively for one Business User, it is:
  - The Staff User's voluntary choice;
  - Not required or encouraged by HireProStaff;
  - Inadvisable and contrary to Platform model;
  - Still within a multi-client framework (other Business Users remain available);
- Even in this scenario, other factors (no control, no integration, no economic dependence) rebut presumption.

 6.3 Staff User Attestation and Confirmation

6.3.1 Initial Registration Attestation

Upon registration, Staff Users must review and accept the following attestation:

"INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS ATTESTATION

I, HEREBY CONFIRM, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND ATTEST THAT:

1. Independent Contractor Status:  
   I understand that I am registering on the HireProStaff Platform as an INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, not as an employee. I am not an employee of HireProStaff or any Business User.

2. No Employment Relationship:  
   I understand that no employment relationship exists or will exist between myself and HireProStaff or between myself and any Business User, regardless of the number of Shifts I work or the duration of my Platform use.

3. Control and Autonomy:  
   I understand and agree that:
   - I have complete control over whether to accept or decline Shifts;
   - I determine my own working hours and schedule;
   - I am not subject to control over how I perform my work;
   - I apply my own professional judgment and expertise;
   - I am not integrated into HireProStaff's organization.

4. Rate Setting:  
   I understand that HireProStaff sets my Rate Level based on my verified experience, qualifications, and skills, and that this rate-setting function:
   - Is a marketplace regulation function, not an employer control function;
   - Ensures compliance with minimum wage legislation;
   - Maintains Platform quality and market consistency;
   - Does not create an employment relationship.

5. Economic Independence:  
   I confirm that:
   - I am not economically dependent on HireProStaff for my livelihood;
   - I maintain or intend to maintain multiple income sources;
   - I bear my own business risks;
   - I am responsible for my own profit and loss;
   - Platform income supplements rather than replaces other income.

6. Multi-Client Engagement:  
   I understand that I am free to and encouraged to:
   - Work for multiple Business Users;
   - Use competing platforms;
   - Maintain direct client relationships;
   - Engage in other employment or business;
   - Diversify my income sources.

   I understand that as an independent contractor:
   - I am not entitled to any employment benefits (leave, UIF, etc.);
   - I must make my own tax payments and statutory contributions;
   - I must arrange my own insurance coverage;
   - I bear all business expenses;
   - I am not protected by certain labour legislation.

8. Voluntary Relationship:  
   I confirm that:
   - I voluntarily choose to work as an independent contractor;
   - No coercion or duress has been applied;

   I acknowledge that:
   - I have been advised to seek independent legal and tax advice if uncertain about my status;
   - I understand the implications of independent contractor classification;
   - I have made an informed decision to proceed.

BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT I AGREE I HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND ACCEPT THIS ATTESTATION.

6.3.2 Ongoing Shift-by-Shift Confirmation

Each time a Staff User accepts a Shift, the Platform presents a confirmation screen stating:

"By accepting this Shift, you confirm that you are acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee. You understand that you have freely chosen to accept this Shift and may decline future Shifts without penalty."

Staff Users must affirmatively click "I Confirm" to proceed.

6.3.3 Annual Re-Attestation

On each anniversary of registration, Staff Users must re-confirm their understanding and acceptance of independent contractor status by reviewing and accepting an updated attestation.

6.3.4 Legal Effect of Attestations

These attestations:
- Evidence Staff Users' informed understanding of their status;
- Demonstrate voluntary acceptance of independent contractor classification;
- Rebut any claims of ignorance or misunderstanding;
- Provide evidentiary weight in any classification dispute;
- Do NOT preclude legal challenges (courts may look beyond form to substance) but strengthen HireProStaff's position.

 6.4 Consequences of Status Challenge

6.4.1 Possibility of Challenge

Despite the clear independent contractor framework, HireProStaff acknowledges that:
- Staff Users retain the legal right to challenge their classification;
- Courts and tribunals have ultimate authority to determine employment status;
- Classification is determined by the substance of the relationship, not just its form;
- Litigation risk cannot be entirely eliminated.

6.4.2 If Employment Status Determined

In the event that a court, tribunal, or arbitrator determines that an employment relationship exists despite this Agreement and all safeguards:

(a) Limited Scope:
- The determination applies ONLY to the specific Staff User(s) involved in the proceeding;
- It does NOT automatically affect other Staff Users' status;
- Each relationship must be assessed independently;
- HireProStaff will vigorously defend the independent contractor classification for other Users.

(b) Remediation:
- HireProStaff reserves the right to modify Platform operations to ensure compliance;
- Affected Staff User(s) must cooperate in regularizing their status;
- HireProStaff may offer alternative arrangements or terminate the relationship;
- No inference should be drawn regarding other Users.

(c) No Admission:
- A determination in one case does NOT constitute an admission for other cases;
- HireProStaff reserves the right to appeal adverse determinations;
- HireProStaff will continue to operate the Platform on an independent contractor basis unless legislation requires otherwise.

6.4.3 Indemnification for Misclassification Claims

Staff Users who have provided false information, misrepresented their circumstances, or acted contrary to independent contractor status (e.g., by behaving as employees, demanding employment benefits, or creating apparent employment relationships) agree to indemnify HireProStaff for any losses arising from such conduct (see Section 19 for full indemnification provisions).

 6.5 Preservation of Rights

6.5.1 Staff User Rights

Nothing in these Terms prevents Staff Users from:
- Seeking legal advice regarding their status;
- Challenging their classification through appropriate legal channels;
- Exercising statutory rights that apply to independent contractors;

6.5.2 HireProStaff Rights

Nothing in these Terms prevents HireProStaff from:

14.1.3 Rate Assignment Process:

During registration and vetting, HireProStaff:
- Reviews Staff User's work history and experience;
- Verifies qualifications and certifications;
- Assesses references and recommendations;
- Evaluates skills demonstrations or portfolios;
- Assigns appropriate Rate Level based on holistic assessment;
- Clearly communicates assigned rate to Staff User.

14.1.4 Rate Progression:

Staff Users may progress to higher Rate Levels through:
- Gaining additional experience and years of service;
- Obtaining advanced qualifications or certifications;
- Consistently high performance ratings (4.5+ stars);
- Demonstrating exceptional skills or specializations;
- Periodic performance reviews by HireProStaff.

Rate Level increases are at HireProStaff's discretion and are not guaranteed.

14.1.5 Rate Transparency:

- Staff Users' assigned rates are clearly displayed in their accounts and profiles;
- Business Users see Staff Users' rates when booking;
- No hidden fees or rate surprises;
- Rate adjustments are communicated with 30 days notice.

 14.2 Flexibility for Lower-Level Shifts

14.2.1 Accepting Below-Rate Shifts:

Staff Users MAY accept Shifts with rates BELOW their assigned Rate Level at their sole discretion.

Permitted:
- Expert-level Staff User accepting Intermediate-level Shift;
- Advanced-level Staff User accepting Entry-level Shift;
- Any downward flexibility Staff User chooses.

Rationale:
- Allows Staff Users to fill schedule gaps;
- Enables gaining experience in new areas;
- Maximizes income during slow periods;
- Builds relationships with new Business Users;
- Provides flexibility for Staff Users.

Important: Accepting lower-rate Shifts does NOT reduce the Staff User's assigned Rate Level for future bookings.

14.2.2 Prohibited: Accepting Above-Rate Shifts:

Staff Users MAY NOT accept Shifts with rates ABOVE their assigned Rate Level unless they have been formally promoted to that higher Experience Level by HireProStaff.

Prohibited:
- Entry-level Staff User accepting Advanced-level Shift;
- Intermediate-level Staff User accepting Expert-level Shift;
- Any upward shift beyond assigned level.

Rationale:
- Ensures Business Users receive the quality and experience they pay for;
- Maintains Platform integrity and user expectations;
- Prevents inexperienced Staff Users from taking on roles beyond their capabilities;
- Protects Staff Users from being placed in situations they cannot handle;
- Ensures safe, competent service delivery.

Platform Enforcement: The Platform automatically prevents Staff Users from applying for Shifts above their Rate Level.

 14.3 Minimum Wage Compliance

ALL rates set by HireProStaff meet or exceed:
- National Minimum Wage as prescribed by the National Minimum Wage Act 9 of 2018;

- Area C (towns and rural): Lower rates may apply but not below national minimum.

HireProStaff's rates are set to comply with the HIGHEST applicable minimum (national vs. sectoral).

14.3.3 Living Wage Commitment:

HireProStaff is committed to facilitating fair compensation:
- All rates significantly exceed minimum wage thresholds;
- Entry-level rates start at 80%+ above national minimum wage;
- Rates reflect market realities and living costs, particularly in major metros like Cape Town and Johannesburg;
- Annual rate reviews ensure competitiveness and fairness.

14.3.4 Prohibition on Below-Minimum-Wage Arrangements:

- No Shift may be posted with rates below applicable minimum wage;
- Platform automatically rejects such postings;
- Any attempt to circumvent minimum wage (e.g., side agreements for lower pay) is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of these Terms and South African labour law;
- Violations will result in immediate account deactivation and potential legal action.

 16. REFUND POLICY

 16.1 Refund Principles

Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis following thorough investigation of the circumstances. HireProStaff's Refund Policy aims to balance fairness to both Business Users and Staff Users while maintaining Platform integrity.

16.1.2 Platform Fee Non-Refundability:

The Platform Fee component of Total Shift Cost is generally non-refundable as it compensates HireProStaff for:
- Platform technology and infrastructure provision;
- Vetting and verification services;
- Payment processing facilitation;
- Customer support and dispute resolution;
- Administrative costs incurred regardless of Shift completion.

EXCEPTION: Platform Fees may be refunded in cases of HireProStaff error or system failure.

 16.2 Full Refund Scenarios

Business Users are entitled to FULL REFUND of the Total Shift Cost (including Shift Rate and Platform Fee) in the following circumstances:

16.2.1 Staff User No-Show:

Where the Staff User:
- Fails to attend the Shift without cancellation notice;
- Does not check in at Shift start time;
- Cannot be contacted and does not respond to communications;
- Has not provided any valid explanation within 24 hours of scheduled Shift start.

Refund Process:
- Business User reports no-show through Platform within 24 hours;
- HireProStaff contacts Staff User for explanation;
- If no valid excuse (genuine emergency) is provided within 48 hours, full refund is processed;
- Refund credited to Business User's original payment method within 5-7 business days;
- Staff User faces disciplinary action per Section 9.5.5(c).

16.2.2 Gross Misconduct by Staff User:

Where the Staff User engages in gross misconduct during the Shift, including:
- Theft or dishonesty;
- Violence, threats, or intimidation;
- Sexual harassment or assault;
- Being intoxicated or under the influence of drugs;
- Gross negligence causing significant damage or harm;
- Refusal to work or abandonment of Shift;
- Other conduct so serious it justifies immediate Shift termination.

Refund Process:

- HireProStaff investigates within 48-72 hours;
- If gross misconduct is substantiated, full refund is processed;
- Staff User is immediately deactivated;
- Criminal matters are reported to police.

Prorated Refund: Where gross misconduct occurs partway through Shift, refund is prorated (refund for unworked portion + full Platform Fee refund).

16.2.3 Staff User Incompetence or Misrepresentation:

Where the Staff User:
- Grossly misrepresented their qualifications, skills, or experience;
- Is completely unable to perform the basic tasks required;
- Lacks fundamental competence for the role (e.g., experienced chef who cannot cook, bartender who doesn't know how to mix drinks);

- Provide specific examples of incompetence with evidence;
- HireProStaff investigates including Staff User interview;
- If material misrepresentation or incompetence is confirmed, full or partial refund is processed;
- Staff User's Rate Level may be downgraded or account deactivated.

Important: Normal performance variations or Business User dissatisfaction with subjective work quality do NOT qualify for refunds. Refunds are for GROSS incompetence only.

16.2.4 HireProStaff Error or System Failure:

Where refund is due to HireProStaff's error:
- Double-booking or system error preventing Shift fulfillment;
- Incorrectly vetted Staff User (e.g., inaccurate criminal check);

Where Shift is started but not fully completed due to:
- Staff User leaving early (without valid excuse);
- Business User ending Shift early (for valid performance reasons, not mere preference);
- Mutual agreement to end Shift early;
- Incident or emergency requiring early termination.

Refund Calculation:
- Business User receives refund for UNWORKED hours;
- Staff User receives payment for WORKED hours;
- Platform Fee is proportionately allocated or retained by HireProStaff;
- Example: 8-hour Shift, Staff User worked 5 hours then left without excuse:

Where Staff User's performance is substandard but not grossly incompetent:
- Late arrival (30+ minutes);
- Lackluster attitude or effort;
- Minor mistakes or inefficiency;
- Failure to meet all expectations but still providing some value.

Refund Process:
- Partial refund (typically 10-25% of Shift Rate) may be offered at HireProStaff's discretion;

- Staff User receives reduced payment;
- Poor performance rating impacts future bookings.

 16.4 No Refund Scenarios

- Business User decides to cancel Shift after Staff User has accepted;
- Applies regardless of cancellation timing;
- See Section 17 (Cancellation Policy) for applicable cancellation fees;

Important: These scenarios may trigger Cancellation Policy provisions but NOT refunds.

16.4.4 Changes of Mind:

 17. CANCELLATION POLICY

 17.1 Cancellation by Staff Users

17.1.1 Right to Cancel:

Staff Users have the right to cancel accepted Shifts, subject to notice requirements and consequences outlined in Section 9.5.

17.1.2 No Cancellation Fees for Staff Users:

- Staff Users do NOT pay cancellation fees;
- Consequences are reputational (ratings, warnings, suspensions) rather than financial;

17.1.3 Refund to Business User:

When Staff User cancels with adequate notice (12+ hours) or genuine emergency:
- Business User receives full refund of Total Shift Cost;
- Refund processed within 3-5 business days;
- Business User may rebook Shift with another Staff User.

 17.2 Cancellation by Business Users

17.2.1 Right to Cancel:

Business Users have the right to cancel confirmed Shifts, but cancellation fees apply to compensate for disruption to Staff Users who have committed their time.

17.2.2 Cancellation Fee Structure:

Cancellation fees are calculated based on timing of cancellation relative to scheduled Shift start:

| Cancellation Timing | Cancellation Fee | Staff User Compensation | Platform Fee | Refund to Business User |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 48+ hours before | 10% of Shift Rate | 10% of Shift Rate | Retained | 90% of Shift Rate |
| 24-48 hours before | 25% of Shift Rate | 25% of Shift Rate | Retained | 75% of Shift Rate |
| 12-24 hours before | 50% of Shift Rate | 50% of Shift Rate | Retained | 50% of Shift Rate |
| 6-12 hours before | 75% of Shift Rate | 75% of Shift Rate | Retained | 25% of Shift Rate |
| <6 hours before or after start | 100% of Shift Rate | 100% of Shift Rate | Retained | R0 (no refund) |

Platform Fee: In all cancellation scenarios, the Platform Fee is retained by HireProStaff (non-refundable) as services have been provided (vetting, matching, booking coordination, payment processing, cancellation administration).

17.2.3 Rationale for Cancellation Fees:

Cancellation fees exist to:
- Compensate Staff Users for committed time and declined alternative opportunities;
- Discourage frivolous or last-minute cancellations;
- Protect Staff User income stability;
- Maintain Platform reliability and trust;
- Cover Platform administrative costs.

Important: Cancellation fees are NOT penalties but rather compensation for losses suffered by Staff Users and Platform costs incurred.

17.2.4 How to Cancel:

- Cancel through Platform's cancellation function;
- Select cancellation reason from dropdown;
- Provide brief explanation (required);
- Confirm understanding of applicable cancellation fee;
- Cancellation is immediate upon confirmation;
- Staff User is notified immediately;
- Cancellation fee and refund (if applicable) are processed within 3-5 business days.

17.2.5 Cancellation Due to Emergency or Force Majeure:

Where cancellation is due to genuine emergency or force majeure events beyond Business User's reasonable control:
- Natural disasters (floods, fires, earthquakes);
- Government-mandated closures or restrictions;
- Serious venue emergencies (building damage, utilities failure);
- Death or serious illness of Business User or immediate family;
- Other unavoidable circumstances;

Reduced or Waived Cancellation Fees:
- Business User should immediately contact HireProStaff: cancellations@hireprostaff.co.za;
- Explain emergency circumstances with supporting documentation;
- HireProStaff may reduce or waive cancellation fees at its sole discretion;
- Staff User still receives compensation (typically 25-50% depending on notice);
- Platform Fee may be refunded or credited in genuine emergency situations.

NOTE: The following are NOT considered emergencies:
- Business being slower than expected;
- Financial difficulties;
- Finding alternative staffing;
- Changes of mind or preference;
- Weather that does not prevent venue operation.

 17.3 Mutual Cancellation

17.3.1 Agreement to Cancel:

Where both Staff User and Business User mutually agree to cancel:
- Either party initiates cancellation;
- Other party confirms mutual agreement;
- No cancellation fees apply;
- Full refund (including Platform Fee) issued to Business User;
- No negative consequences for either party.

Mutual cancellation is appropriate where:
- Circumstances change affecting both parties;
- Alternative arrangements are made outside Platform (subject to Section 10.5.5 restrictions);
- Shift is no longer needed or feasible for both parties.

17.3.2 Process:

- Initiating party requests mutual cancellation through Platform messaging;
- Other party confirms agreement within 24 hours;
- Both parties confirm through cancellation function;
- Refund processed within 3-5 business days.

 17.4 Cancellation Due to Policy Violations

17.4.1 HireProStaff-Initiated Cancellation:

HireProStaff may cancel Shifts where:
- User violates these Terms;
- Fraudulent booking is suspected;
- Safety concerns arise;
- Account is suspended or deactivated;
- System error requires cancellation.

17.4.2 Refunds in Violation Scenarios:

- If Business User violated Terms: No refund; full payment to Staff User + Platform Fee retained.
- If Staff User violated Terms: Full refund to Business User; Staff User receives no payment.
- If HireProStaff error: Full refund including Platform Fee to Business User; compensation to Staff User at HireProStaff's discretion.

 17.5 Weather-Related Cancellations

17.5.1 General Principle:

Normal weather conditions (rain, heat, cold) do NOT justify cancellation without fees. South Africans are accustomed to variable weather.

17.5.2 Severe Weather Exception:

Cancellation fees may be waived or reduced for:
- Extreme weather warnings (red-level warnings from SAWS);
- Floods, storms, or conditions making travel dangerous;
- Government warnings to avoid travel;
- Venue closure due to weather damage.

17.5.3 Process:

- Business User contacts HireProStaff immediately: emergencies@hireprostaff.co.za;
- Provide evidence of severe weather (SAWS warnings, news reports, photos);
- HireProStaff assesses and determines appropriate cancellation fee adjustment;
- Staff User receives at least 25% compensation unless they agree to waive;
- Decision is made case-by-case.

 17.6 Repeat Cancellations

17.6.1 Pattern of Cancellations:

Business Users who repeatedly cancel Shifts may be:
- Required to pre-pay higher Prepayments (e.g., 125% of Shift Cost, with excess refunded upon completion);
- Subject to account review and potential restrictions;
- Required to provide documented reasons for cancellations;
- Suspended or deactivated for chronic unreliability.

Thresholds:
- 3+ cancellations within 30 days triggers review;
- 5+ cancellations within 90 days may result in account restrictions;
- 10+ cancellations within 180 days may result in deactivation.

Exceptions: Legitimate, documented emergencies are not counted against Business Users.

 PART F: LIABILITY AND RISK ALLOCATION

 18. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 18.1 Fundamental Disclaimer

READ CAREFULLY - THIS SECTION SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS HIREPROSTAFF'S LIABILITY

18.1.1 Platform Service Provider Role:

- No guarantee that Staff Users will meet Business User expectations or requirements;
- No guarantee of Staff User skill, competence, reliability, or professionalism;
- No guarantee that Business Users will provide safe, lawful, or appropriate work environments;
- No warranty that Shifts will be completed satisfactorily or without incident.

18.2.2 No Warranty of Availability:
- No guarantee of Platform uptime or continuous availability;
- Platform may be unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or technical issues;
- No guarantee that Shifts will be available for Staff Users or that Staff Users will be available for Business Users.

18.2.3 No Warranty of Accuracy:
- No guarantee that User profiles, ratings, or information are accurate or current;
- No guarantee that vetting processes will identify all risks or disqualifying factors;
- Users are responsible for verifying information themselves.

18.2.4 No Warranty of Security:
- While HireProStaff implements reasonable security measures, no guarantee of absolute security;
- No warranty against data breaches, hacking, or unauthorized access despite best efforts.

 18.3 Exclusion of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, HireProStaff (including its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, and affiliates) shall NOT be liable for:

18.3.1 Indirect and Consequential Damages:

No liability for:
- Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages;
- Loss of profits, revenue, business opportunities, data, or goodwill;
- Business interruption or loss of use;
- Reputational harm;
- Costs of substitute services or goods;
- Any damages beyond direct, actual losses.

This exclusion applies even if HireProStaff has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

18.3.2 User Conduct:

No liability for:
- Actions, omissions, conduct, or negligence of Staff Users during Shifts;
- Actions, omissions, conduct, or negligence of Business Users toward Staff Users;
- Theft, property damage, or destruction caused by Users;
- Injuries, harm, or death caused by Users to themselves or others;
- Discrimination, harassment, or illegal conduct by Users;
- Breach of contract between Staff Users and Business Users;
- Disputes, conflicts, or relationship breakdowns between Users;
- Criminal conduct by Users;
- Any other User misconduct or violations of law.

Users acknowledge that HireProStaff is not present during Shifts and has no ability to prevent or control User conduct.

18.3.3 Third-Party Actions:

No liability for:
- Actions of third parties (venue guests, customers, vendors, contractors);
- Theft, assault, or harm caused by third parties;
- Premises defects or dangerous conditions caused by third parties;
- Interruptions or failures of third-party services (payment processors, cloud hosts, internet providers).

18.3.4 Force Majeure:

No liability for failures or delays caused by events beyond HireProStaff's reasonable control, including:
- Natural disasters (floods, fires, earthquakes, storms);
- Government actions (regulations, restrictions, shutdowns);
- War, terrorism, civil unrest;
- Pandemics or epidemics;
- Labor disputes or strikes;
- Telecommunications or internet failures;
- Power outages;
- Any other acts of God or force majeure events.

 18.4 Limitation of Damages

18.4.1 Monetary Cap:

CRITICAL LIMITATION:

HireProStaff's maximum aggregate liability to any User for all claims arising from or related to these Terms or Platform use shall NOT exceed the LESSER of:

(a) The total Platform Fees paid by or to that User in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the claim; OR

(b) R5,000 (Five Thousand Rand).

This cap applies regardless of:
- The legal theory of liability (contract, delict/tort, strict liability, negligence, etc.);
- Whether claims are brought individually or as part of a class action;
- Whether HireProStaff was aware or should have been aware of the possibility of damages.

18.4.2 Example Applications:

- Business User paid R50,000 in total Platform Fees over 12 months → Maximum liability is R5,000 (the lesser amount).
- Staff User earned R20,000 over 12 months (Platform Fees on this would be ~R3,000) → Maximum liability is R3,000.
- New User with only one R500 booking → Maximum liability is R75 (Platform Fee portion).

18.4.3 Rationale:

These limitations are necessary because:
- HireProStaff charges minimal Platform Fees relative to transaction values;
- HireProStaff is a technology facilitator, not a service provider or employer;
- Users control the service relationship and assume risks;
- Unlimited liability would be commercially impossible and would require substantially higher fees;
- These limitations are standard for digital marketplace platforms globally.

 18.5 Limitations Required by Law

18.5.1 Consumer Protection Act:

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits HireProStaff's liability where such exclusion or limitation is prohibited by the Consumer Protection Act, including:
- Liability for death or personal injury caused by HireProStaff's gross negligence;
- Liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by HireProStaff;
- Any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.

18.5.2 OHSA and Vicarious Liability:

Where HireProStaff is found to have specific statutory duties under OHSA or is found vicariously liable for employee/agent actions, such liability is not disclaimed. However, HireProStaff's position is that:
- HireProStaff has no OHSA obligations as it is not the "employer" or "user" of Staff Users at Business User premises;
- HireProStaff has no vicarious liability as Staff Users are independent contractors, not employees or agents.

These positions will be defended vigorously if challenged.

 18.6 User Acknowledgment

By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that:

 21. OCCUPIERS' LIABILITY AND WORKPLACE SAFETY

 21.1 Legal Framework

21.1.1 Common Law Occupiers' Liability:

Under South African common law, occupiers of premises owe a NON-DELEGABLE duty of care to all lawful visitors, including Staff Users. This duty requires the occupier to take reasonable steps to guard against reasonably foreseeable harm.

Key Principles:
- Duty is owed by the person in control of premises (Business User);
- Duty cannot be delegated to contractors or service providers;
- Occupier remains liable even where independent contractors perform work;
- Standard of care is objective: what a reasonable person in occupier's position would do.

21.1.2 Occupational Health and Safety Act:

OHSA imposes statutory duties on:
- Employers (Section 8): Duty to ensure health and safety of employees;
- Users (Section 37(2)): Persons who use workplaces where persons other than their employees work.

Business User Position:
- Business Users are "occupiers" and may be "users" under OHSA where Staff Users work on their premises;
- Business Users have statutory duties to Staff Users under OHSA;
- HireProStaff is NOT an "employer" or "user" under OHSA relative to Staff Users at Business User premises.

 21.2 Business User Obligations and Liability

CRITICAL: BUSINESS USERS BEAR FULL LIABILITY FOR PREMISES SAFETY

21.2.1 Non-Delegable Duty:

Business Users acknowledge that their duty of care for premises safety is NON-DELEGABLE, meaning:
- Duty cannot be satisfied by delegating safety to HireProStaff, Staff Users, or anyone else;
- Business Users remain LIABLE for injuries caused by premises defects or unsafe conditions;
- Hiring independent contractors does not eliminate or reduce the duty;
- Business Users cannot shift liability to HireProStaff through contract terms.

21.2.2 Specific Safety Obligations:

Business Users MUST ensure:

(a) Safe Premises:
- Buildings are structurally sound;
- Floors are level, non-slip, and free of hazards;
- Adequate lighting in all work areas;
- Proper ventilation and temperature control;
- Functional fire safety equipment and clear emergency exits;
- Safe electrical systems and equipment.

(b) Safe Equipment:
- All equipment and machinery is safe, properly maintained, and fit for purpose;
- Guards, safety devices, and interlocks are in place and functional;
- Equipment defects are repaired promptly;
- Staff Users are trained on equipment use.

(c) Hazard Management:
- Identify all workplace hazards (slips, trips, falls, burns, cuts, chemical exposure, violence risks);
- Eliminate hazards where possible;
- Minimize hazards where elimination is not possible;
- Warn Staff Users of hazards that cannot be eliminated;
- Provide safe work procedures and training.

(d) Personal Protective Equipment:
- Provide necessary PPE at no cost to Staff Users;
- Ensure PPE is appropriate, fits properly, and is maintained;
- Train Staff Users on proper PPE use.

(e) Emergency Preparedness:
- Maintain first aid facilities and trained first aiders;
- Have emergency evacuation procedures and conduct drills;
- Maintain fire extinguishers, alarms, and emergency lighting;
- Post emergency contact numbers;
- Ensure Staff Users know emergency procedures.

21.2.3 Liability for Injuries:

Business Users are LIABLE for:
- Injuries caused by premises defects or unsafe conditions;
- Injuries caused by inadequate safety measures or equipment;
- Injuries caused by failure to warn of hazards;
- Injuries caused by inadequate training or supervision;
- Occupational diseases contracted due to workplace exposures;
- Legal costs of defending claims;
- Damages, medical expenses, and compensation awarded.

This liability exists regardless of:
- Staff User's status as independent contractor;
- Existence of indemnification provisions;
- Attempts to waive liability;
- Contributory negligence by Staff User (may reduce but not eliminate liability).

 21.3 HireProStaff's Non-Liability for Premises

21.3.1 No Control of Premises:

HireProStaff has:
- NO control over Business User premises;
- NO ability to inspect, monitor, or enforce premises safety;
- NO presence at venues during Shifts;
- NO authority to direct safety measures or compliance.

21.3.2 No Occupiers' Liability:

HireProStaff is NOT an occupier and therefore has NO occupiers' liability for injuries occurring at Business User premises. Occupiers' liability rests EXCLUSIVELY with Business Users as the parties in control of premises.

21.3.3 Platform Role Only:

HireProStaff's role is limited to:
- Requiring Business Users to acknowledge safety obligations in these Terms;
- Recommending Business Users maintain insurance;
- Providing educational resources on safety (optional);
- Facilitating incident reporting;
- NOT inspecting, auditing, or enforcing premises safety.

21.3.4 Staff User Assumption of Risk:

Staff Users acknowledge and accept that:
- HireProStaff has not inspected Business User premises;
- HireProStaff makes NO representations about premises safety;
- Staff Users attend venues at their own risk;
- Staff Users must assess safety upon arrival and refuse work in unsafe conditions;
- Business Users, not HireProStaff, are responsible for premises safety.

 21.4 Staff User Safety Rights and Responsibilities

21.4.1 Right to Safe Workplace:

Staff Users have the right to:
- Work in safe conditions free from reasonably foreseeable harm;
- Receive safety information, training, and equipment;
